Plan for converting the lua levels to javascript
1. Export the lua brickdata as a json object
2. Export the javascript brickdata as a json object
3. Create a mapping of brick ids from lua -> json
	a. modify the json objects first so the arguments match
4. Export the mapping as a json object
5. Read each level into lua and export into json using the mapping
